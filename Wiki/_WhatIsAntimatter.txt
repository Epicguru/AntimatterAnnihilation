#!What is it?#
#<b>Antimatter is the opposite of regular matter</b>. For every particle, there is an anti-particle that has the <i>same mass</i> but <i>opposite charge</i>.#
#When matter and antimatter come into contact, a reaction known as <i><color=\#db63d7>annihilation</color></i> occurs. The two particles are destroyed and a certain amount of energy is released, based on the equation <i>E=mcÂ²</i>.#

#!How do I make it?#
#To create and store antimatter, you will need a <i><color=\#3468eb>particle accelerator</color></i>. This machine requires a lot of power and a constant supply of Plasteel, and will produce Antimatter Canisters.#

#!What is it used for?#
#Antimatter canisters can be used to create certain items and weapons.
It is also used to create <i><color=\#9534eb>antimatter composite</color></i> by combining the canisters with Plasteel in a <i><color=\#34dceb>Composite Refiner</color></i>.#
