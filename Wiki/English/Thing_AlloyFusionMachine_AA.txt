#!How to set up#

#At least 3 <color=\#e0d290>Input Trays</color> must be built around the Alloy Fusion Machine, as shown here:#
$AntimatterAnnihilation/UI/AlloyMachine$

#One of the trays must be configured to store gold, another to store antimatter composite and the last one to store uranium.
You can quickly configure the trays by using the buttons, as shown here:#
$AntimatterAnnihilation/UI/AlloyTraySetup$

#Finally, the output side must be configured.
By clicking the <i>Change output side</i> button on the machine, you can change which direction the Hyper Alloy will be placed in.#
$AntimatterAnnihilation/UI/AlloyOutputSetup$
#The output side does not require a tray, but you can place one down for aesthetic purposes if you want.#

#!How it works#
#This machine will automatically pull gold, uranium and antimatter composite.
Once it has the minumum amount of each stored in it's internal buffer, it will start producing hyper alloy.
Once it has started running (it will begin to glow and do an animation), it will take by default 1 in-game hour to produce 1 hyper alloy.
This time can be reduced by increasing the Power Level of the machine, which also increases the amount of power it uses.#
