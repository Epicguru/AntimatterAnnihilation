#!Configure the output side#
#By clicking the <i>Change output side</i> button on the machine, you can change which direction the Hyper Alloy will be placed in.#

#!How it works#
#Once your colonists have fuelled the machine with enough gold, uranium and antimatter composite, it will start running.
Once it has started running (it will begin to glow and do an animation), it will take by default 1 in-game hour to produce 1 hyper alloy.
This time can be reduced by increasing the Power Level of the machine, which also increases the amount of power it uses.#
