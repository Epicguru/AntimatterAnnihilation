#!Welcome to Antimatter Annihilation!#

#This is an end-game mod that adds powerful items, weapons, defences and materials. It also adds a mysterious and powerful new faction, who will try to keep the secret of antimatter technology at any cost.#
#This is the in-game wiki. It will guide you through the mod's steps and phases.#

#I recommend reading the <i>What Is Antimatter</i> page for a bit of a lore/science primer before you start.
Otherwise, to get started see the <i>Getting Started</i> page.#
