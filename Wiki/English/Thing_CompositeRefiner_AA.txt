#!How it works#
#Once your colonists have fuelled this machine with 60 plasteel and 1 antimatter canister, it automatically begin running.
Once it has started running (as can be seen in the inspection panel), it will take 6 in-game hours to produce an output of 30 antimatter composite.#
#The output is placed directly below the machine, in it's interaction spot (white circle)#
