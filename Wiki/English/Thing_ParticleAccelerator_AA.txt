#!How to set up#
#Simply build it somewhere in your colony, ideally in a place where it won't be destroyed by raiders.
Your colonists will automatically haul Plasteel to fuel the accelerator once it has been built.#

#!How it works#
#It needs a constant supply of power and plasteel. It will output 1 antimatter canister every 12 in-game hours, at the cost of 10 plasteel each.
The output is dumped on the floor on one of the sides of the accelerator. This side can be configured using the 'Change output side' button.#
