#!How to set up#
#Simply build it somewhere in your colony, ideally in a place where it won't be destroyed by raiders.
Your colonists will automatically haul Plasteel to fuel the accelerator once it has been built.#

#!How it works#
#It needs a constant supply of power and plasteel. It will output 1 antimatter canister every 12 in-game hours, at the cost of 10 plasteel each.
The output is dumped on to the floor on the bottom edge of the accelerator, where the interaction spot is.#
