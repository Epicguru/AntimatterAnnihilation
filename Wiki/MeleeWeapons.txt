An overview of the melee weapons added to the game by this mod.

#Most melee weapons added by this mod can be crafted at a smithing table or a fabrication bench once the research is complete.

You can also craft vanilla weapons using <i><color=\#9534eb>antimatter composite</color></i>, which has very strong damage and defense modifiers.#
