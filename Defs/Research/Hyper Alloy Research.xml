        <discoveredLetterTitle>About hyper alloy</discoveredLetterTitle>
        <discoveredLetterText>Your research has lead you to the discovery of Hyper Alloy, an alloy of gold, uranium and antimatter composite.
Data suggests that it will have incredible properties that would make it far superior to any alternative in terms of strength and versatility.
In order to manufacture it, a special facility will be needed.</discoveredLetterText>
