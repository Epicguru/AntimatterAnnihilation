        <description>Of all the data grabbed in the initial Ultratech hack, the data about Hyper Components may be the most interesting and confusing.
Hyper components appear to combine antimatter and archotech technology, but you don't quite understand how. It is obvious that crafting these components will be impossible, but you might be able to use them if you somehow get your hands on them.
The Ultratech faction may have some, but they won't give them up voluntarily...</description>
