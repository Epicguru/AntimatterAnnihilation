        <description>Based on the design of the Thunder Gun, this railgun uses advanced AT fields to accelerate antimatter to the speed of light before launching it towards an unfortunate target.</description>

        <discoveredLetterText>You now understand how to construct antimatter railguns.
Antimatter railguns make convential projectile launchers seem primitive. They fire antimatter channeled through an AT field, giving it a theoretically infinite range and dealing massive damage in the impact area.

You will need to aquire Hyper Components to build them.</discoveredLetterText>
