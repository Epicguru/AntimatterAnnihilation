        <description>Learn how to build the M3G_UMIN, a stationary defence system that interacts with ancient satelites to redirect a beam of energy to a disired position on the planet's surface.
Hyper components will be required to create and maintain an AT field going from the surface all the way to low planet orbit.</description>

        <discoveredLetterText>You can now construct the M3G_UMIN, once you aquire enough Hyper Components.
The M3G_UMIN will not automatically attack enemies, because it is too destructive. It uses antimatter canisters to fire, and has a very long cooldown.
Don't target anything near something you care about loosing!</discoveredLetterText>
